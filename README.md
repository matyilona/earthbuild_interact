# earthbuild\_interact
Add interactive ways of obtaining the blocks/items in the erathbuild mod.

So far:
- Both cob and mudbrick have a wet version, it dries up if placed in the world
- Wet cob is crafted by dropping dirt and some plant material (papyrus, grass, etc.) in water
- Wet mudbrick is crafted by punching wet cob with a stick
- Wattle is built by placing a stick, only sticks can be used to start it
- Wattle now has 4 heights, sticks, papyrus and saplings can be used to make it higher
- Rightclicking full height wattle with cob creates wattle and daub
